# MarkerAR

This is an iOS sample project of a simple Augmented Reality app using images as Markers. There is a little bit controversy with Markerless term because you still need something to track (any image) and others prefer to call it Natural Feature AR.

The purpose of the project to serve as a mockup for those who want to learn how this technology works from inside.

It only uses OpenCV as a dependency, that is not included in the project because of its size. You can download it here:
